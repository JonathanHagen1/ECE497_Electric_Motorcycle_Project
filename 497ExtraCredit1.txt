Mass of total original bike: 104 kg. 
Comes with hub motor; http://www.qs-motor.com/product/12inch-new-260-model-1000w-5000w-qs-hub-motor/
- That motor has a different serial number but it looks idential to the one in the video, has the same specs as the one described, and came up on google when the first half of the serial number was googled.
Weight of motor = 15 kg
Comes with 2 battery packs - each 6x13x3. They appear to be 18650s, which are ~45 g each. 
Found exact battery pack: https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Lithium-72v-motorcycle-rechargeable-battery-for_1600078206876.html?mark=google_shopping
11kg each
Chasis weight (including PE) = 67 kg

Determine feasibility, do analysis on his bike and optimize it - run out of energy right at the end of quarter mile + traction = A
*Or we can analyze/put together one on our own - exclude his bike and find motor, batteries, etc to end at quarter mile
Lean forward over bike for all weight on back wheel for traction?
Contact person who worked on the bike for dimensions - may not respond but Dr. Scott recommended it.

Top Speed 45mph (Advertised 50 mph)
Range 30 miles
80 ah Lithium Battery (20-45 from Amazon)
Brushless DC motor; 3000W,5000W,8000W power usage at motor
72 V
Charging time 6-8 hours
Can go up a 30 degree slope, no higher(?)
Don't need a special charging station
Dimensions; 2100*800*1200 mm
LED Headlight
LCD Speedometer

Company; 1-2.5 million revenue/year, employs 11-50 ppl.
Has a certificat of conformity number BEL20170000101119 - Russian Certificate. Might show reliability?

Seller only has 8 reviews, with an average of 4.3/5

Only one-star review is due to shipping time and different colors from what was ordered (for different products)

Find a similar bike and use their EPA stats; need to find rolling resistance of tires
Could find a comparison between the two.

Try sending the manufacturer an email to ask for a production bike that's equivalent 
Recommend a bike that you could buy and install after market products

2 types of motors for EVs: Axial Flux Motor/Generator; Mount in center of bike or a hub motor that goes directly to wheel
Could save room for battery in center. Battery can be small as it's a racing bike
Hub motor can be lighter
Dual Hub-motors? Might be able to match the power of the Flux Motor; one on each/sycronization?
Batteries; Cylindrical style Lithium ion(regular) in 18650s (size), prismatic/polymer - Like phone batteries
Want the highest discharge rate; maybe several in parallel for more current

Need to find balance between weight for traction and weight for acceleration - Matlab?

https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/tractive-effort-d_1783.html - Traction Coefficient. Force of traction = coeff * normal force (effects of gravity). Traction needs to be greater than T*omega
