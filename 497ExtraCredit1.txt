Determine feasibility, do analysis on his bike and optimize it - run out of energy right at the end of quarter mile + traction = A
*Or we can analyze/put together one on our own - exclude his bike and find motor, batteries, etc to end at quarter mile

Top Speed 45mph (Advertised 50 mph)
Range 30 miles
80 ah Lithium Battery (20-45 from Amazon)
Brushless DC motor; 3000W,5000W,8000W power usage at motor
72 V
Charging time 6-8 hours
Can go up a 30 degree slope, no higher(?)
Don't need a special charging station
Dimensions; 2100*800*1200 mm
LED Headlight
LCD Speedometer

Company; 1-2.5 million revenue/year, employs 11-50 ppl.
Has a certificat of conformity number BEL20170000101119 - Russian Certificate. Might show reliability?

Seller only has 8 reviews, with an average of 4.3/5

Only one-star review is due to shipping time and different colors from what was ordered (for different products)

Find a similar bike and use their EPA stats; need to find rolling resistance of tires
Could find a comparison between the two.

Try sending the manufacturer an email to ask for a production bike that's equivalent 
Recommend a bike that you could buy and install after market products

2 types of motors for EVs: Axial Flux Motor/Generator; Mount in center of bike or a hub motor that goes directly to wheel
Could save room for battery in center. Battery can be small as it's a racing bike
Hub motor can be lighter
Dual Hub-motors? Might be able to match the power of the Flux Motor; one on each/sycronization?
Batteries; Cylindrical style Lithium ion(regular) in 18650s (size), prismatic/polymer - Like phone batteries
Want the highest discharge rate; maybe several in parallel for more current

Need to find balance between weight for traction and weight for acceleration - Matlab?

https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/tractive-effort-d_1783.html - Traction Coefficient. Force of traction = coeff * normal force (effects of gravity). Traction needs to be greater than T*omega

Guide to go off of?
