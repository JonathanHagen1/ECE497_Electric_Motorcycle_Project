Find a similar bike and use their EPA stats; need to find rolling resistance of tires
Could find a comparison between the two.

Try sending the manufacturer an email to ask for a production bike that's equivalent 
Recommend a bike that you could buy and install after market products

2 types of motors for EVs: Axial Flux Motor/Generator; Mount in center of bike or a hub motor that goes directly to wheel
Could save room for battery in center. Battery can be small as it's a racing bike
Hub motor can be lighter
Dual Hub-motors? Might be able to match the power of the Flux Motor; one on each/sycronization?
Batteries; Cylindrical style Lithium ion(regular) in 18650s (size), prismatic/polymer - Like phone batteries
Want the highest discharge rate; maybe several in parallel for more current

Need to find balance between weight for traction and weight for acceleration - Matlab?
